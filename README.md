Mistouflet DE needs Internet access to install. Please verify your computer has a permanently working Internet connection before launching anything.

To install Mistouflet DE, simply launch install.sh as root. Everything should install automatically.
If, after installation and reboot, you still don't see the Mistouflet DE theme nor wallpaper, run the 'set_config.sh' script and then reboot.
